Building pgAdmin4.dmg on Mac OS X
=================================

Required Packages (Either build the sources or get them from macports or
similar):

1. Python installation
  - Python 3.4+ or above from https://www.python.org/

2. QT installation
  - Qt 5 from http://www.qt.io/

3. PostgreSQL installation
  - PostgreSQL 9.5 or above from http://www.postgresql.org/

Building:

1. If a value different from the default of /usr/local/python is required, set
   the PGADMIN_PYTHON_DIR environment variable to the Python root installation
   directory, e.g.

   export PGADMIN_PYTHON_DIR=/opt/local

2. If a value different from the default of ~/Qt/5.13.2/clang_64, is required,
   set the PGADMIN_QT_DIR environment variable to the QT root installation
   directory, e.g.

   export PGADMIN_QT_DIR=~/Qt/5.14.2/clang_64

3. If a value different from the default of /usr/local/pgsql is required, set
   the PGADMIN_POSTGRES_DIR environment variable to the PostgreSQL installation
   directory, e.g.

   export PGADMIN_POSTGRES_DIR=/opt/local/pgsql

4. Copy framework.conf.in to framework.conf, and edit the values accordingly.

5. If you want to codesign the appbundle, copy codesign.conf.in to
   codesign.conf and set the values accordingly.

6. To build, go to pgAdmin4 source root directory and execute "make appbundle".
   This will create the python virtual environment and install all the required
   python modules mentioned in the requirements file using pip, build the
   runtime code and finally create the app bundle and the DMG in ./dist
   directory.
